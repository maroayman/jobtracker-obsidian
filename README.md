# JobTracker

## Overview
JobTracker is a directory structure for organizing job applications. It helps track different stages of the application process efficiently.

## Folder Structure
- **Accepted** â€“ Offers that have been accepted.
- **Archived** â€“ Applications that didn't receive a response after a long time.
- **Interviewing** â€“ Applications currently in the interview stage.
- **Negotiation** â€“ Offers under discussion.
- **Refused** â€“ Jobs you have declined.
- **Rejected** â€“ Applications that were unsuccessful.
- **Sent** â€“ Submitted applications awaiting a response.
- **Shortlist** â€“ Applications that have progressed to the shortlist stage.

## How It Works
1. Choose your desired path where you want to store the vault.
2. Run the script:
   - Use **PowerShell** if you're on Windows.
   - Use **Bash** if you're on Linux/macOS.
3. Open **Obsidian** and choose "Open folder as a vault."
4. Select the **JobTracker** folder after running the script.
5. Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Now you can organize your job applications efficiently.


## Application Naming Convention
To avoid confusion when applying multiple times to the same company, use the following format:
- Role @ Company @ N-Time
### **Example Naming Format**
- `Software Engineer @ Microsoft @ 1-Time`
- `Software Engineer @ Microsoft @ 2-Time`
- `Data Analyst @ Google @ 1-Time`
- `Product Manager @ Amazon @ 3-Time`

### **Benefits**
âœ… **Clear Tracking** â€“ Easily identify when you've applied to a company before.  
âœ… **Efficient Searching** â€“ Use `@ Company` or `@ N-Time` to quickly find past applications.  
âœ… **Better Organization** â€“ Prevent confusion between different application
